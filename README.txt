John Newhagen - John's Alfa Parts

To run my project, you first have to run the following commands inside of your terminal:
npm i jquery --save
npm install react-slideshow-image -S
npm install --save react-router-dom

The comments that my TA left were very helpful in terms of the user experience side of human-computer interaction.
They talked about how "the conditions for signup aren't very clear." I took this into consideration and I changed 
the placeholder for username to be "Please enter your first name." The other comment my TA left was "I'd work on the 
styling as we move into further renditions of the app." What they meant here was that some of the images and pages 
were zoomed in more than others. I fixed this problem by slightly adjusting the formatting on some of the images and 
pages until they were all the same size.

I plan on using the Ebay API.

I am not entirely sure how I plan on implementing the meta-search engine I talked about in my initial proposal.
Will this matter or can I just use the hardcoded items I already have in my electrical, engine, and brakes pages?

Which pages of my project will the database I plan on using need to be fully functional? I assume I need to actually
store info for login, signup, and checkout, but will there be other parts as well?
